## Paper - Voice2Action

- [Here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00092).

**Abstract**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained and aligned to follow natural language instructions with only a handful of examples, and they are prompted as task-driven autonomous agents to adapt to various sources of execution environments. However, deploying agent LLMs in virtual reality (VR) has been challenging due to the lack of efficiency in online interactions and the complex manipulation categories in 3D environments. In this work, we propose Voice2Action, a framework that hierarchically analyzes customized voice signals and textual commands through action and entity extraction and divides the execution tasks into canonical interaction subsets in real-time with error prevention from environment feedback. Experiment results in an urban engineering VR environment with synthetic instruction data show that Voice2Action can perform more efficiently and accurately than approaches without optimizations.

### Real-World Use Cases

- **Urban Planning and Engineering** 
    - One of the primary use cases demonstrated in the document is in urban engineering VR environments. 
    - Planners and architects can use Voice2Action to interact with a virtual model of a city, manipulating building layouts and planning urban spaces using voice commands. 
    - This can significantly enhance the efficiency and intuitiveness of urban planning processes.

- **Educational Tools and Simulations**
    - In educational settings, Voice2Action can be used to create interactive, VR-based learning environments. 
    - Students can interact with virtual laboratories, historical reconstructions, or complex scientific models using natural language, making learning more engaging and accessible.

- **Healthcare and Medical Training**
    - Voice2Action could be applied in medical training simulations, allowing medical students and professionals to practice procedures and diagnose virtual patients using voice commands. 
    - This would offer a hands-free, immersive learning experience.

- **Gaming and Interactive Entertainment**
    - In the gaming industry, Voice2Action can provide a more immersive and natural way for players to interact with the game environment, characters, and objects, using voice commands to perform actions or control the narrative.

- **Virtual Collaboration and Remote Workspaces**
    - In a remote working context, Voice2Action can be used to enhance virtual collaboration. 
    - Participants in a virtual meeting could interact with shared virtual objects, data visualizations, or models more intuitively using voice commands.

- **Accessibility Applications**
    - Voice2Action can enhance accessibility in virtual environments for individuals with mobility or dexterity limitations. 
    - By using voice commands to interact with virtual environments, it opens up new possibilities for users who might find traditional control methods challenging.

- **Interactive Art and Exhibitions**
    - Artists and exhibitors can use Voice2Action to create more engaging and interactive virtual galleries or installations. 
    - Visitors can interact with the art pieces or exhibit items through voice commands, adding a new layer of engagement.
