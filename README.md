# Voice2Action

- 2024-02-14 Update: Our Unity package "Voice2Action" v-0.0.1 is open for beta testing!

- 2024-03-14 Update: v-0.0.2 is up with embedding-based retrieval system implemented!

[Voice2Action Unity Package v-0.0.2](https://yang-su2000.github.io/Voice2Action/)

This package uses LLMs (Large Language Models) to analyze user instruction through action and entity extraction, and divides the execution tasks into canonical interaction subsets with error prevention from the game engine feedback. It combines an "Expand" interaction technique to create an innovative selection and manipulation mechanism for enhanced user experiences.

## ALICE (Aligning Language models for Interactive Code Execution) 

**ALICE** is a large-scale ongoing project that extends Voice2Action to broader domains, find more about it at [**alicellm.github.io**](https://alicellm.github.io).

- [Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WQyXTJ0Mb6GPep-aIsmwMvYXEUKPvjHm/view?usp=drive_link) (3D Terrain Generation via. User Instruction)
- ALICE is a *meta-agent collaboration system* that generates high-quality data through multi-turn interactions and feedback without human intervention.
- It produces multimodal data with traces from agent strategies like ReAct and Reflexion, which are scarce but offer potential for aligning advanced LLMs.

**ALICE** is kindly supported by [Cornell ICPC](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/acm/) and [Millennium](https://www.mlp.com/) on building **efficient LLMs for code and data generation**.

***We are actively looking for brilliant people to join the ALICE project, shoot me an email if you are interested!***

*We expect to open source ALICE in this Fall, stay tuned for more updates!*

## Advantages

- Efficiency: Extremely **Low Cost**
    - Based on our testing in the "Samples/CityDemo" with 2 ** (7+3) = 1024 function call combinations (with infinite argument combinations) and 100 * 32 = 3.2k user interaction (including multi-turn due to execution failure), our OpenAI API (with gpt-3.5-turbo) total cost ~= 5 USD, which converts to 0.16 cents per interaction!
- Domain Adaptation: Highly **Customizable**
    - User can customize their actions and properties by easily inheriting our Runtime scripts, see examples in the Advanced section for more details.
    - We can also fine-tune our models based on domain-specific manipulation category requirements, stay tuned!
- Scalability: Highly **Parallelizable**
    - While the current package is a minimal implementation of the full Voice2Action framework, all property classes can do their jobs in parallel without any intervention as they belongs to different manipulation categories.
    - More importantly, by adapting Unity (Unreal, or other game engine) functional impact analysis (including controlled experiments, parameterized testing, dependency analysis and [profiling](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Profiler.html)), we are able to integrate the LLMs function calling and feedback ability into Unity runtime, while maintaining the parallelizability of each scripting and rendering components, hence this package is an initial attempt as a multi-agent collaboration framework for game engine code execution.

**Abstract**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained and aligned to follow natural language instructions with only a handful of examples, and they are prompted as task-driven autonomous agents to adapt to various sources of execution environments. However, deploying agent LLMs in virtual reality (VR) has been challenging due to the lack of efficiency in online interactions and the complex manipulation categories in 3D environments. In this work, we propose Voice2Action, a framework that hierarchically analyzes customized voice signals and textual commands through action and entity extraction and divides the execution tasks into canonical interaction subsets in real-time with error prevention from environment feedback. Experiment results in an urban engineering VR environment with synthetic instruction data show that Voice2Action can perform more efficiently and accurately than approaches without optimizations.

### Limitations and Future Work

- The current Voice2Action package only supports inference, i.e. you cannot fine-tune your model based on domain-specific action types. We plan to open source that in future versions.
- We plan to decouple the LLM feature and the Expand feature into different packages in future versions.
